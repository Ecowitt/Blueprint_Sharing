# Ecowitt Blueprint Sharing

#### Instruction Manual

1.  All 3D files provided here have been physically 3D printed and tested by our team to ensure proper fit and real-world usability.
2.  We provide two standard 3D file formats: .STL and .STP, making the files suitable for both direct 3D printing and further design modification.
3.  These files are intended for users who own a 3D printer, as well as users who prefer to download the files and have the parts manufactured by a third-party 3D printing service.
4.  For non-commercial use

At the moment, we are not yet sure how many users need this accessory. Therefore, we are temporarily providing the 3D files so that users can print it themselves.

If you prefer not to print it yourself, please let us know in the comments. Your feedback is very important to us and will help us better understand actual demand.

Please understand that the cost of mass production is relatively high. Before the demand becomes clear and sufficiently strong, we are unable to manufacture this accessory at scale.
